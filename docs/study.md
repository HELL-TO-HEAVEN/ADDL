# Introduction
Try to get higher AD diagnostic precision, we group the ADNI MRI data into several study groups, design different diagnostic methodologies, and apply ADDL pipeline. Specially, we get about 95% AD diagnostic precision.

# Data Selection
The data selection groups ADNI data into several study groups, which helps find the AD features by crossing comparing AD diagnostic results of study groups. Base on different methodologies, we groups the ADNI data into following five groups.
1. `ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL`
1. `ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL_Scale2`
1. `ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL_Scale2_LessNL`
1. `ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL_FilterScores`
1. `ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL_FilterScores_Scale2`

## `ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL`
Select pure AD and NL subjects as a group without MCI subjects and subject who transfer AD from NL. This is the baseline of following data selection.

**Detail Process**<br>
1. Remove subjects with non-uniform diagnose information (DX), excluding subjects whose DX changes among visits, for example NL->MCI->AD.
1. Remove subjects with all empty diagnose information (DX).
1. Remove subjects with diagnose information (DX) being MCI.
1. For each subject, if its diagnose information (DX) is empty, infer its diagnose information (DX) according to the following rules.
   1. If diagnose information (DX) of the first visit (VISCODE = bl) is AD, all diagnose information (DX) of subsequent visits are AD.
   1. If the last non-empty diagnose information (DX) is NL, all diagnose information (DX) before that visit are NL.
1. Remove all data records with empty diagnose information (DX).

**Data List**<br>
The ADDL project stores the `ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL` group as an example instance, that is named  [Rule1_ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL](..\examples\Rule1_ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL).
* `dataList_ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL.dat` is the data list of `ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL` study group.
* `dataList_ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL_test.dat` is the validation set of this study group.
* `dataList_ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL_train.dat` is the training set of this study group.

## `ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL_Scale2`
Besides baseline data selection, for each data that has a ‘Scale_2’ version, the corresponding ‘Scale’ version is removed. The phantom scaling of ['Scale_2'](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/scaled-2-uploads/) is more reliable. So this study group remove the data pends on ADNI preprocess sequence.

**Data List**<br>
The ADDL project stores the `ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL_Scale2` group as an example instance, that is named  [Rule2_ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL_Scale2](..\examples\Rule2_ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL_Scale2).

* `dataList_ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL_Scale2_train.dat` is the training set of this study group.

## `ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL_Scale2_LessNL`
Based on ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL_Scale2, about half of the NL data are removed. We reduce the NL data, which means raise the AD data ratio in the study group, expect that the DL module contains more AD features for higher precision.

**Data List**<br>
The ADDL project stores the `ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL_Scale2_LessNL` group as an example instance, that is named  [Rule3_ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL_Scale2_LessNL](..\examples\Rule3_ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL_Scale2_LessNL).

* `dataList_ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL_Scale2_LessNL_train.dat` is the training set of this study group.

## `ADNI_1.5T_All_AD_NL_FilterScores`
Besides applying common rules. For each subject, if one if its data record's cognition testing score, CDRSB, ADAS11 or MMSE, is not resides in a given range, the whole subject is removed. We keep the data with more AD and NL features with the test score filter, expect the DL module contains more AD and NL feature for higher precision.

**Table of Subjects Score Range**<br>

||NL Low|NL High|AD Low|AD High|
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|CDR-SB|-0.096|0.156|2.811|6.203|

# Diagnostics
The last stage of ADDL inference process is diagnostics, which basing on the DL module inference result vector get the diagnostics result. Each element of the results vector indicate the AD classification result by the DL module of a 2D image along the Z axe. Considering the tissue spatial allocation, weight of location etc, we designed several strategies for the final diagnostics.


## Numbers
Base on the number comparing between AD and NL is a straightforward method, the more AD results hints more AD feature found for a subject. This is the baseline of all the strategies. The pseudo code is listed below.
```
if number_of_AD_png > number_of_NL_png:
		subject_class = AD
else:
		subject_class = NL

```

## Continuous
Considering the feature should be continuous in 3D spatial, to mitigate the impact of single PNG result, we get continuous methodology. The pseudo code is listed below.
```
if there exists continuous N AD png:
	subject_class = AD
else:
	subject_class = NL

```

This strategy gets different N in different data selections, and overall accuracy is better than baseline strategy in the study group 1 only.

## Low Z Location
According to medical research, hippocampus tends to show the most rapid loss of tissue earliest in Alzheimer’s disease. Only bottom N PNG files are checked instead of all PNG of baseline strategy. The pseudo code is listed below.
```
In the bottom N PNG files:
if number_of_AD_png > number_of_NL_png:
		subject_class = AD
else:
		subject_class = NL
```

This strategy has a common N in different data selections. Although not all study groups achieve the best overall accuracy under this N, but all groups get better performance than baseline strategy.

# Conclusions
1. The higher AD/NL ratio gets higher precision, which is same as the expectation from study group 3(1.43) and 4(1.58), that the higher AD/NL ratio make DL module contains more AD features.
1. Higher precision from study groups 4 and 5, which is same as the expectation, that the test score filter hold more AD/NL features in the DL module. But the concern is study group data amount is small to support this.
1. The diagnostic method "Low Z location" get higher precision, hints the hippocampus tissue contains more AD features.
