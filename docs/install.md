# Installation Introduction
The ADDL project are based on Bash, R and Python programming language. The project algorithm and interface develop in Python. Plenty of third party tools are involved in this project, the Bash, R and Python also work as script language. The project only support Linux. Our working operation system(OS) is CentOS7.

The installation of project is very easy, just source copy. But the third party tools setting up cost a lot. The project pends on two independent types of tool set, the neuroimaging processing tool set and deep learning(DL) tool set. Considering the dependency of software versions, OS and hardware, this section introduces a full process to setup all the required tools based on the CentOS7 minimal installation.

getent passwd python2

# Create a user named python2
useradd python2

# Assign a password to python2, e.g. abc123
echo abc123 | passwd python2 --stdin

# Optional if you want assign python2 sudo with password.
usermod -aG wheel python2
```  

# Deep Learning Tool Set
Currently, GPU is the most common computation accelerator for DL algorithm. The DL tool set is typically divided into two suits, the hardware vender provided tools and the DL framework. The hardware vender provided tools contain driver(interface of device and OS), CUDA(the general GPU computation framework) and cuDNN(the DL algorithm optimization library). The DL framework connects developer and hardware, it helps developer achieve DL application easily and fast, and taking the hardware work efficiently. There are lots of DL frameworks such as TensorFlow, Caffe2, PyTorch, etc. This project is using TensorFlow, that is the most common DL framework.

## Determination Versions
There are native dependency and latency between hardware vender provide tools and DL frameworks, so the latest version of DL framework is a bit later than the latest version of hardware vender provided tools. One should take care of the versions of DL tools. Building a local version of DL framework pends on your local hardware vender provided tool for the edge features is out of this document scoping. Driver is usually backward compatible, the latest one should be fine because Driver, CUDA and cuDNN are good maintained inside hardware vender.

The TensorFlow official provides detail GPU tools requirement, please check [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#NVIDIARequirements) for detail information. Till this document, the latest stable TensorFlow version is [1.6](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v1.6.0), and the NVIDIA tool set requirement are shown below.
* CUDA = 9.0
* cuDNN = 7.0

# Neuroimaging Processing Tool Set
The rapid progress of research in the neuroscience and neuroimaging fields has been accompanied by the development of many excellent analysis software tools. These are implemented in a variety of computer languages and programming environments. This project take use of two packages FSL and ANTsR for brain extraction, registration, grey matter extraction etc.

----

## [FSL](http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/)
FSL is a comprehensive library of analysis tools for FMRI, MRI and DTI brain imaging data. It runs on Apple and PCs (both Linux, and Windows via a Virtual Machine), and is very easy to install. Most of the tools can be run both from the command line and as GUIs ("point-and-click" graphical user interfaces). To quote the relevant references for FSL tools you should look in the individual tools' manual pages.

The FSL download and install is easy, that handle with a FSL install tool named `fslintaller.py`. But the FSL install package is more than 2G, we suffered install fail caused by download fail, so we suggest offline download package first. The detail download and install process are listed below.

**Download**<br>
1. Download the FSL install tool from url `https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads/fslinstaller.py`.
2. Get the FSL package url base on OS from FSL install tools.
   1. Search the `download_file()` function defination in the `fslinstaller.py`, adding the print url code.
```python
def download_file(url, localf, timeout=20):
    '''Get a file from the url given storing it in the local file specified'''
    print url # Hey,new adding here!
    try:
        rf = open_url(url, 0, timeout)
    except OpenUrlError, e:
        raise DownloadFileError(str(e))
```

   2. Get the FSL package url by the following command, and then Control-c.
```bash
python fslinstaller.py -o
```

The FSL package url is `https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads/fsl-5.0.10-centos7_64.tar.gz`.

**Install FSL Command**<br>
```bash
python fslinstaller.py -f fsl-5.0.10-centos7_64.tar.gz -M -d /usr/local/fsl -q
```

## [ANTsR](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTsR)
ANTsR is a package providing ANTs features in R as well as imaging-specific data representations, spatially regularized dimensionality reduction and segmentation tools.

ANTsR interfaces state of the art image processing with R statistical methods. The project grew out of the need, at University of Pennsylvania, to develop large-scale analytics pipelines that track provenance from scanner to scientific study. ANTsR wraps an ANTs and ITK C++ core via Rcpp to access these frameworks from within R and support reproducible analyses. Specialized functionality in ANTsR includes image segmentation and registration along imaging specific variations of principal component and canonical correlation analysis.

### Components Introduction
**[R](https://www.r-project.org)**<br>
R is a freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics which provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques: linear and nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering, etc.

**[INK](https://itk.org)**<br>
ITK is an open-source software toolkit for performing registration and segmentation. Segmentation is the process of identifying and classifying data found in a digitally sampled representation. Typically, the sampled representation is an image acquired from such medical instrumentation as CT, MRI or ultrasound scanners. Registration is the task of aligning or developing correspondences between data. For example, in the medical environment, a CT scan may be aligned with a MRI scan in order to combine the information contained in both.

**[INKR](http://github.com/stnava/ITKR)**<br>
ITKR provides R-based access to the Insight ToolKit (ITK) for medical image processing, registration and segmentation.

**[ANTs](http://stnava.github.io/ANTs)**<br>
The ANTS framework provides open-source functionality for deformable normalization with large deformations. Small deformation mappings and segmentation tools are also available.  Developer evaluation showed stronger differences with other methodology in neurodegenerative neuroimaging data, where large deformation is required. ANTs serves as both a base for further algorithm development and also as an application-oriented toolkit. ANTS enable diffeomorphic normalization with a variety of transformation models, optimal template construction, multiple types of diffeomorphisms, multivariate similarity metrics, diffusion tensor processing and warping, image segmentation with and without priors and measurement of cortical thickness from probabilistic segmentations. The normalization tools, alone, provide a near limitless range of functionality and allow the user to develop customized objective functions. Objective functions in ANTS are of the form: Deformation Cost + Data Terms, and the command line reflects this balance of two terms. As mentioned above, the data term may combine multiple different measures of similarity that are optimized in parallel, for instance, image similarity and landmark terms.

**[ANTsRCore](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTsRCore)**<br>
A package providing core features for ANTsR.

**[Extrantsr](https://github.com/muschellij2/extrantsr)**<br>
Extrantsr extends the ANTsR package with simple wrappers and complex processing streams for neuroimaging data.

The project implements brain extraction through Extrantsr.

### Installation
The ANTsR installation is a high cost process, which contains package download and source build process. Try to accelerator the process please choosing a CPAN mirror nearly, and assign more threads for the build process. The Extrantsr contains ANTsR install process.

It has C++, Python and Java interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android. OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. Written in optimized C/C++, the library can take advantage of multi-core processing. Enabled with OpenCL, it can take advantage of the hardware acceleration of the underlying heterogeneous compute platform.

**Install opencv-python Command**<br>
```bash
pip install opencv-python
